# ðŸ“˜ Overview â€“ What This Workflow Does

The **Supabase to Airtable â€“ Lead Capture Workflow** is an n8n automation that simplifies how new leads are collected, validated, and processed.

Whenever a new row is added to your **Supabase lead table**, this workflow:

1. **Extracts & formats** the data  
2. **Validates the email address** format  
3. If valid:
   - Creates a new lead in **Airtable**
   - Sends a **welcome email** using Gmail
   - Updates the Supabase record with a success status  
4. If invalid:
   - Logs the error in a dedicated Airtable table
   - Sends an error response
   - Updates the Supabase record with an error status
