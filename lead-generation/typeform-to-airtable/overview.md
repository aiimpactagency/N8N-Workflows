Lead Loop Starter Workflow - Detailed Explanation
Purpose & Overview
The Lead Loop Starter Workflow is an automated lead capture and nurturing system that seamlessly connects Typeform submissions to your CRM (Airtable) while instantly engaging new leads with personalized welcome emails. This workflow eliminates manual data entry, ensures no lead falls through the cracks, and provides immediate engagement with prospects.
Step-by-Step Process
1. Webhook Trigger Reception
The workflow begins when a lead completes your Typeform
Typeform sends a POST request to your n8n webhook endpoint
The webhook captures all form data including name, email, interest, and source
Data is immediately available for processing without any delay
2. Data Validation & Transformation
A Set node validates that all required fields are present
Email format is verified using regex patterns
Data is cleaned and formatted for consistency
Missing fields are handled with default values
Special characters are escaped for database compatibility
3. CRM Record Creation
The Airtable node creates a new lead record in your CRM
All form data is mapped to corresponding Airtable fields
Submission timestamp is automatically added
Lead status is set to "New" for tracking
The record ID is captured for future reference
4. Personalized Email Generation
Email content is dynamically generated using lead data
Subject line includes the lead's name for personalization
Email body references their specific interest area
Professional formatting is applied automatically
Fallback values ensure emails always send successfully
5. Email Delivery
The configured email service (Gmail/SMTP) sends the welcome email
Delivery status is tracked for monitoring
Failed sends trigger the error handling flow
Successful sends are logged for reporting
Trigger Analysis
Primary Trigger: Webhook
Type: HTTP POST webhook
Path: /typeform-leads
Authentication: None (relies on webhook URL security)
Response Mode: On Received (immediate acknowledgment)
Activation: Fires instantly when Typeform submission completes
Secondary Triggers (Optional Enhancements):
Schedule Trigger: For batch processing or follow-ups
Manual Trigger: For testing and troubleshooting
Error Trigger: Activates when main workflow fails
Action Breakdown
1. Webhook Node Actions
Receives JSON payload from Typeform
Parses nested form_response structure
Extracts answers array
Makes data available to subsequent nodes
Returns 200 OK status to Typeform
2. Set Node Actions
Maps Typeform answer structure to flat JSON
Validates email format: /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/
Ensures required fields exist
Applies data transformations
Sets default values for optional fields
3. IF Node Actions
Evaluates data quality conditions
Routes valid leads to CRM creation
Sends invalid data to error handling
Checks for duplicate prevention
Implements business logic rules
4. Airtable Node Actions
Authenticates using API key
Creates record in specified table
Maps all fields with proper data types
Handles Airtable-specific formatting
Returns created record ID
5. Email Node Actions
Composes email using template
Inserts dynamic content
Sets proper headers
Handles authentication
Tracks send status
Data Flow Mapping
1. Typeform → Webhook
{
  "event_id": "01234567",
  "form_response": {
    "submitted_at": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
    "answers": [
      {
        "field": {"id": "name_field", "type": "short_text"},
        "type": "short_text",
        "short_text": "John Doe"
      },
      {
        "field": {"id": "email_field", "type": "email"},
        "type": "email",
        "email": "john@example.com"
      }
    ]
  }
}

2. Webhook → Set Node
Extracts nested answers
Flattens to simple structure:
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "interest": "Product Demo",
  "source": "Website",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z"
}

3. Set Node → Airtable
Maps to Airtable fields
Adds metadata:
{
  "fields": {
    "Name": "John Doe",
    "Email": "john@example.com",
    "Interest": "Product Demo",
    "Source": "Website",
    "Submitted At": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
    "Status": "New"
  }
}

4. Airtable → Email Node
Uses created record data
Generates personalized content
Sends to lead email address
Error Handling
1. Webhook Errors
Invalid JSON: Logged and rejected
Missing required fields: Routed to error flow
Timeout: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
2. Airtable Errors
API limit exceeded: Queue and retry
Invalid field mapping: Fallback to basic fields
Connection failure: Store locally and batch later
3. Email Errors
Invalid recipient: Log and notify admin
SMTP failure: Retry with backup service
Template errors: Use plain text fallback
4. General Error Flow
Capture error details
Log to error tracking table
Send admin notification
Attempt recovery if possible
Mark lead for manual review
Use Cases
1. SaaS Product Signups
Capture trial requests
Segment by plan interest
Trigger onboarding sequences
Track conversion metrics
2. Consultation Bookings
Collect contact information
Identify service needs
Send prep materials
Schedule follow-up calls
3. Event Registrations
Register attendees
Send confirmation emails
Build attendee database
Trigger reminder sequences
4. Content Downloads
Gate valuable content
Build email lists
Track engagement
Nurture with related content
5. Support Inquiries
Capture issue details
Create support tickets
Send acknowledgment
Route to appropriate team
